Error: Turbopack build
 failed with 1 errors:
./src/proxy.ts
Proxy is missing expec
ted function export na
me
This function is what 
Next.js runs for every
 request handled by th
is proxy (previously c
alled middleware).

Why this happens:
- You are migrating fr
om `middleware` to `pr
oxy`, but haven't upda
ted the exported funct
ion.
- The file exists but 
doesn't export a funct
ion.
- The export is not a 
function (e.g., an obj
ect or constant).
- There's a syntax err
or preventing the expo
rt from being recogniz
ed.

To fix it:
- Ensure this file has
 either a default or "
proxy" function export
.
